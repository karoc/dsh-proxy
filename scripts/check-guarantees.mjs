/**
 * Guarantee gate: every negative guarantee documented in `docs/guarantees.md`
 * must be pinned by an assertion label that actually exists in this repo's
 * spec sources. A promise without a pinning assertion is not a promise.
 *
 * Why this repo needs it: the routing guard shipped for months matching only
 * the literal `127.0.0.1`, while the README promised "loopback targets are
 * always direct". The assertion that was supposed to catch it passed for the
 * wrong reason (the fixture's `proxiedHosts` did not contain the host it was
 * asserting about, so the function returned "direct" through the unlisted-host
 * branch) — the guard could have been deleted and the suite stayed green.
 *
 * Rules enforced:
 *   1. `docs/guarantees.md` exists and carries rows `| <id> | <guarantee> | <selector> |`;
 *   2. every selector occurs in `scripts/*.spec.mjs` (this repo's specs use
 *      labelled assertions rather than per-test titles, so the label is the pin);
 *   3. the table has at least MIN_ROWS rows (a gutted table fails).
 *
 * A missing guarantee is a hard failure, not a warning.
